exit: exit [n]
Exit the shell. The exit command is used to terminate the current shell session or exit from a script. When the exit command is executed, the shell will be closed, and you will return to the previous environment. Exits the shell with a status of N. If N is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. This status code is used to indicate the success or failure of the shell session or script. Properly handling exit statuses is important for scripting and debugging, as it helps in determining how the script or command executed.
