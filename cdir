cd Command: cd [-] [dir]
This command is used to change the current working directory in Unix-based shells. If no directory is specified, the command changes the directory to the user's home directory. If the specified directory is not found, and the cdable_vars shell option is set, the command assumes that the argument is a variable name and attempts to use its value as the directory path. The command can also use environment variables to simplify navigation. Using cd - allows quick switching between the current and previous directories, making directory management more efficient.

Options: (-)
Use the cd command with - to redirect the current working directory to the previous working directory and set an environment variable OLDPWD. This option helps in toggling between two directories.

Exit Status
The command returns an exit status of 0 if the directory is changed successfully and if $PWD is set correctly. If not, it returns a non-zero number indicating an error.
